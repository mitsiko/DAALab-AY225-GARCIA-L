# Sorting Algorithm Console Program

## Overview
This is a **console-based Python program** that allows the user to sort a dataset of numbers using one of three sorting algorithms:  

1. **Bubble Sort**  
2. **Insertion Sort**  
3. **Merge Sort**  

Users can also select the sorting order: **Ascending** or **Descending**.  

The program measures the total time taken to **load the dataset, sort it, and display the sorted results**.  

The dataset is read from a text file named `dataset.txt` located in the **same directory** as this Python script.

## Features
- Interactive console menu to choose sorting algorithm and order.  
- Measures time taken for loading, sorting, and displaying the dataset.  
- Works with datasets of any size (limited by your system memory).  
- Displays the sorted dataset directly in the console.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.  
- A text file named `dataset.txt` in the same folder as the script. Each line in the file should contain a single integer. Example:

34
7
23
32
5
62

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal app).  
2. Navigate to the folder containing the Python script and `dataset.txt`.  
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
