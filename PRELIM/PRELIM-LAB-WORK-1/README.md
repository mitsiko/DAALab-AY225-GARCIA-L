# Bubble Sort Console Program

## Overview
This is a **console-based Python program** that sorts a dataset of integers using **Bubble Sort in descending order**.  

The dataset is read from a text file named `data.txt` located in the **same directory** as the Python script. The program measures the **total time** taken to load the dataset, sort it, and display the sorted results in the terminal.

## Features

1. **Bubble Sort Only:** The program implements the Bubble Sort algorithm.  
2. **Descending Order Sorting:** All numbers are sorted from largest to smallest.  
3. **Accurate Timing:** The program measures the time taken to **load the dataset, perform the sorting, and display the results**.  
4. **Console-based Interface:** Simple text-based execution without any GUI.  
5. **Flexible Dataset:** Any number of integers can be included in `data.txt`, one per line.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system.  
- `data.txt` file located in the same folder as the Python script.  
  - The file should contain **one integer per line**, for example:

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal app).  
2. Navigate to the folder containing the Python script and `data.txt`.  
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
